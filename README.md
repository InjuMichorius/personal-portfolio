# Design patterns and Best Practices 👩🏻‍💻
__Code standards are important__ when working on any project; your code stays *consistent* and is *readable* for everyone. I defined code standards for __HTML__, __CSS__ and __JS__ while working on this project.

## Javascript code standards
* Variables & functions are written in __camelCase__
* Promises are handled with __async functions__ using await
* I don't use var, only __const__ or __let__
* I put __spaces around operators__ ( = + - * / ) and after commas (exception for for loops)
* I use indentation with __TAB__
* I always end a statement with a __semi-colon;__
* Functions have their opening bracket on the __same line__ as the name, with 1 space in between
* I use __ES6 syntax__ where possible

## CSS code standards
* I try to avoid __!important__ as much as possible
* Layout/general styling is always __above__ more specific styling
* Selectors are not unnecessary __long__ nor __short__
* I use __CSS3 syntax__ where possible
* I avoid old display properties like float
* CSS Selectors must have a __space__ between the name and bracket

## HTML code standards
* I only use IDs when the element is present __once__ on a page and it's necessary for styling or Javascript
* I always write semantic HTML according to __W3C Validator__
* Divs are only used when __necessary__ for styling purposes
* Classes allow easy __re-usage__
* Indentation is always __clear__
